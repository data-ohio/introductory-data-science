# Estimator and Sampling Distribution

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to estimate the parameters of a model, use simulation methods to evaluate different estimators, and describe their bias and variance.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Identify the parameters of a statistical model to be estimated.
* Compute one-sample summaries (estimates) of the center of a distribution – mean, median, and trimmed mean.
* Simulate samples of data from a generative model, summarize the sample with an estimator, and examine the estimator’s sampling distribution (histogram / density estimate), its center and its spread.
* Use the center and spread of the sampling distribution to describe the accuracy of an estimator in terms of bias and variance.
* Simulate data to explore and evaluate sampling distributions of estimators in complex statistical models.

Our first readings, from [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) {cite}`DATA8text`, discusses the parameter(s) of a distribution and estimating these parameters with a statistic (or several statistics).

```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* What is the difference between a parameter and a statistic?
* What is the difference between the distribution of a population and the distribution of a statistic?
```

Our second readings, also from [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) {cite}`DATA8text`, go deeply into estimating two statistics: the mean and the standard deviation.

```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* When will the mean equal the median?
* What does the standard deviation tell about how spread out the data is?
* What is the difference between the standard deviation of the data and the standard deviation of sample means?
* Is the sample mean a [biased or unbiased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator) estimator of the population mean?
