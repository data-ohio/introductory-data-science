```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Diagnose and repair shortcomings of a statistical model. Contrast the implications of a statistical model with subject matter knowledge to identify its shortcomings. Improve the model by introducing new predictors, by altering the probability distribution used in the model, or by creating a more complex probability structure.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Contrast the implications of a statistical model with subject matter knowledge to identify flaws in the model.  
* Incorporate a new predictor into the model to reflect subject matter knowledge.
* Replace one probability distribution with another to modify the model.
* Introduce an additional component of variation to create dependence in observed data.
