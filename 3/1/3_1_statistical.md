# Statistical Model

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to write and implement generative models for situations ranging from simple one-sample problems to more complex settings.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Generate data from standard probability distributions such as the binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, the normal distribution, and the gamma distribution.
* Draw a graphic (histogram / density estimate) to describe a sample of data.
* Write a statistical model that includes both structured components and stochastic components such as a simple linear regression model with normal errors, a multiple linear regression model, or a logistic regression model.
* Generate data from a complex statistical model.
* Write a statistical model that includes more than one stochastic component such as a mixed model for linear regression.
