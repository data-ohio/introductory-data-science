# Simulation-Based Estimation and Prediction

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to use simulation methods to understand the implications of statistical models. 
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Estimate the probability of an event for a simple probability model from a simulation.
* Assess the accuracy of an estimated probability.
* Estimate the probability of an event in a complex statistical model from a simulation.
* Estimate the conditional probability of one event given another event for models with a single component of variation and for models with more than one component of variation.
* Estimate implications (features) of a statistical model. These features might be a percentile of a distribution for a specified value of the predictor, the regression coefficient itself, or the odds for logistic regression.
* Make a prediction for new data from the model.
