```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Formulate statistical inference as a decision problem, specify a generative statistical model, a target of inference, and a loss function, and then select an estimator by minimization of average loss over simulated data sets.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Choose among mean, median, and trimmed mean as an estimator in a simple model, when the target is the center of the distribution and the loss function is squared error loss.  (Note that the choice will depend on the generative model).
* Understand 0-1 loss for a two-choice problem.
* Demonstrate that the loss function determines the target of estimation (e.g., estimation of a quantile can be accomplished by minimization of an asymmetric absolute error loss function).  
* Make use of squared error predictive loss in a simple linear regression setting.  •Design a loss function for a problem of the student’s choosing.
