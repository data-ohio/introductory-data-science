# Supervised Learning

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to classify data using supervised machine learning techniques, search for and define a function that describes how different measured variables are related to one another and utilize predictive techniques such as linear regression.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Identify, or give an example of, an unsupervised learning technique.
* Identify, or give an example of, a supervised learning technique.
* Classify data using K-nearest neighbors.
* Classify discrete data using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
* Use simple linear regression analysis to predict the value of a response variable based on a given explanatory variable.
* Interpret the y-intercept and make inferences about the slope of a simple linear regression equation.
* Evaluate the assumptions of regression analysis and know what to do if the assumptions are violated.
* Interpret the correlation coefficient.
* Describe the purpose of multiple linear regression.
* Input variable information and data for multiple linear regression.
* Describe and discern the data assumptions required for multiple linear regression.
* Interpret scatterplots and probability plots concerning the data assumptions for multiple linear regression.
* Write a prediction equation and make predictions based on a multiple linear regression model.
* Use a command such as lm() in R to perform multiple linear regression.
* Use logistic regression to describe the relationship between an explanatory variable and a dichotomous response variable.
* Compare and contrast logistic regression and ordinary least squares regression.
* Fit a logistic model and use the model to estimate the odds from a single probability.
* Describe the statistical model of logistic regression with a single explanatory variable.
* Identify the estimates of the regression parameters and write the equation for a fitted model.
* For a given logistic model, compute and interpret the threshold value.
* Use a command such as glm() in R to perform logistic regression.
