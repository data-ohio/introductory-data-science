# Unsupervised Learning

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to use algorithms to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. 
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Identify data that is relevant to K-means clustering.
* Describe the basic steps of the K-means clustering algorithm.
* Interpret an elbow graph to determine the optimal number of clusters.
* List the advantages and disadvantages of K-means clustering.
* Use a command such as kmeans() in R to solve applications of K-means clustering.

Machine Learning](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.00-machine-learning.html) in the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) {cite}`VANDER:2016`, explains *k-means clustering* and how to use `sklearn` to perform it.

```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* What goes wrong if k is too small?
* What goes wrong if k is too large?
* What is a *confusion matrix*?
