# Traditional Plots

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to classify and summarize data using traditional plots.
````

```{admonition} Sample Tasks:
* Before undertaking any activity, students must answer the following questions:
  * What are you trying to show?
  * Does a trendline, heat map, time series, etc. make sense in this case?
  * Why will one type of graph work better than another?
  * Emphasize that the data and analysis must tell the story, and the charts are a helpful tool to tell the story.
  * State with clarity what you are trying to say.

### Plotting via Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a (the?) standard plotting library in python.
Typically you load it in a python session with

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

### Plotting via Seaborn

Seaborn is a plotting library built on top of Matplotlib to automatically give nice plots for statistical data in pandas dataframes.
Typically you load it in a python session with

    import seaborn as sns
