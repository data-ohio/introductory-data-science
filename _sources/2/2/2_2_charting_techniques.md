# Single vs. Two or More Variables

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to select appropriate charting techniques based on the type of data and the number of variables they intend to present.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Discuss differences between numerical and categorical data.
  - What types of charts are appropriate for numerical data?
  - What types of charts are appropriate for categorical data?
* Effects of outliers
  - Explain the difference between an explanatory variable and a response variable.
  - Generate a general hypothesis about the relationship between two variables.
  - Construct a scatter plot using a large data set containing 1000+ points.
  - Confirm that a trendline is appropriate for the data.
  - Build a linear model using the trendline.
  - Examine the outliers and decide if they should be included in the model.
  - If appropriate, remove the outliers, adjust model, plot a new trendline, and build a new model.
  - Compare the two plots, trendlines, and models.
  - Summarize the effects of the outliers on the response variable.
