# Distribution Maps

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to identify common distribution models and discern what types of data fit certain models.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Student will be able to create distribution maps of quantitative variables
  - Biological data that fit the normal distribution such as blood pressure, height, and weight
  - Data that does not fit the normal distribution such binomial or Bernoulli distributions
  - Students analyze wait times and build an appropriate distribution map based on their observations.
  - Student will investigate heat maps and choose to highlight different variables.
* Voting patterns:
  - Student will find a large data set of voting information for a certain state or county.
  - Students create maps to display the voting information.
  - Students make a hypothesis about voting patterns in a certain geographic area.
  - Student will analyze the different areas and a manipulate the fineness of measurement to highlight various areas.
  - Based on the observations, the students will verify the hypothesis.
  - Students will describe a future data set that would allow them to confirm their hypothesis.
* Plotting a data set with large variation for a market study
  - Find a data set of ages for customers that visit McDonalds for breakfast
  - Plot the entire data set using an appropriate chart
  - Look for a pattern (we hope that it does not exist)
  - Generate a hypothesis that could pertain to breakfast promotion
  - Break the data into subsets
	* Age range
	* Time of morning
	* Day of the week
   - Replot using the subsets
   - Look for a pattern to verify your hypothesis
   - Summarize the process
   - Present as a marketing pitch

Our first readings, from [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) {cite}`DATA8text`, are repeated from {numref}`sec:visualize_single_vs_two` and remind us how to plot distributions in 1 variable.

Our second readings, from  [Learning Data Science](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/) {cite}`DATA100text`, are also repeated from {numref}`sec:visualize_single_vs_two`.
These remind us how to plot distributions in 1 and 2 variables.

```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* What does it mean for a distribution to skew right?
* What does it meant for a distribution to have a long tail?
```

Our third reading, also from [Learning Data Science](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/) {cite}`DATA100text`, discusses distributions on geographic maps.

When studying a distribution, one question to ask is how well it fits the distribution of a known statistical model, such as a normal distribution. 
We will study such statistical models in {numref}`sec:statistical_model`.
