# Misleading Graphs

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to locate data visualizations and deconstruct the graph in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Find graphics in the “wild” and bring them into class to critique.
  - Example of bad graphs could be the following:
	* Non-zero axis
	* Zero axis
	* Pie charts versus bar charts versus histograms
	* Inappropriate pictograms
  - The goal of the project is for students to find intentionally misleading graphs.
  - Students will critique each example of a bad graph and explain why it is inappropriate in the given situation.
  - Students will propose a more appropriate presentation for the same data and explain why that presentation is the better choice.
  - Students will proceed to create an example using the appropriate presentation.
  - In the end the students present the inappropriate and appropriate graphs to the class for side-by-side comparison.
* Choosing to highlight proper information.
  - Student will choose variables they want to highlight from a larger set of variables.
  - Student will need to decide what they want to show.
	* Cases
	* Hospitalizations
	* Deaths
  - Student will explain the importance of one set of variables versus another.
	* Student will experiment with different color-coding schemes to highlight important variables, and decide between the following:
	  - Standard pallet
	  - Custom pallet
	* Students will justify their choice.
	* Student will discuss disability issues such as color blindness.

A visualization can be misleading if either it is poorly done or if the creator is trying to deceive. 

Our first readings, from [Learning Data Science](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/) {cite}`DATA100text`, are repeated from {numref}`sec:dynamic_visualization`.
These remind us how to plot well, to avoid unintentionally being misleading.

Our second reading, from [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) {cite}`DATA8text`, is repeated from {numref}`sec:visualize_single_vs_two`.
It describes a principle that is often violated in advertising to distort relative sizes.

```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* What is the *Lie factor*?

Our fourth reading, from [Statistics How To](https://www.statisticshowto.com/), discusses several examples of misleading graphs used in the press.

```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* Which misleading graph angered you the most?
* How long would it take you to find a misleading graph on the internet?
