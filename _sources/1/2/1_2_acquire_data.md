```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to acquire raw data from a variety of sources.
````

```{admonition} Sample Tasks: 
* Distinguish between different sources of data such as relational database, automated data collection, and online surveys.
* Discern between structured data sources, sources that are searchable such as relational databases, and unstructured data sources, sources that are not searchable such as social media and text messages.
* Collect data from open or public data sources such as data.gov, IPUMS, Kaggle, Quandl, The World Bank, US Census Bureau, NASA, Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform.
* Convert a file from its present format into a format that is prepared for analysis.

Our first reading, from [Principles and Techniques of Data Science](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/) {cite}`DATA100text`, gives some examples of different types of data available and the formats they might be in.
* [8. Wrangling Files](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/08/files_intro.html)  
  * [8.1. Data Source Examples](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/08/files_datasets.html)  
  * [8.2. File Formats](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/08/files_formats.html)  

 ```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* What does *CSV* stand for?
* Why does't everyone use the same file format?
``` 
  
Rather than reading more text on different data formats, spend a few minutes (or a few hours) exploring what is available on the internet. 
Some places to look:
* [The State of Ohio's Data Portal](https://data.ohio.gov)
* [The United States Federal Government Data Portal](https://data.gov)
* [The United Nations Data Portal](http://data.un.org/)

 ```{admonition} Reading Questions
