# Unsupervised Learning

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to use algorithms to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. 
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Identify data that is relevant to K-means clustering.
* Describe the basic steps of the K-means clustering algorithm.
* Interpret an elbow graph to determine the optimal number of clusters.
* List the advantages and disadvantages of K-means clustering.
* Use a command such as kmeans() in R to solve applications of K-means clustering.
