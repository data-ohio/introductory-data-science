```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to define machine learning and statistical learning, as well as differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning. 
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Identify, or give an example of, an unsupervised learning technique.
* Use a package such as caret in R to perform a machine learning algorithm.

Our first reading, from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) {cite}`VANDER:2016`, gives an overview of different types of machine learning.

```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* What is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?
  Give an example of each.
```	

Our second reading is Wikipedia's entry [Statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory), which describes similar problems from a different angle.


```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* What is the difference between Machine Learning and Statistical Learning?
```

Our third reading, also from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) {cite}`VANDER:2016`, gives on overview of the `sklearn` library of machine learning algorithms, which we will learn more about in {numref}`sec:supervised_learning` and {numref}`sec:unsupervised_learning`.

```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* What does *API* stand for?
* What is a *model*?
* What is a *hyperparameter*?
```
