```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to cite sampling bias in its various forms.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Identify data which is “cherry picked.” That is, selecting data that supports a particular position while ignoring relevant contradictory evidence.
* Characterize a sample of data influenced by nonresponse bias and explain that this bias is influenced by the salience of a study or its social appeal.
* Explain and pinpoint studies that could be affected by interviewer bias or from a voluntary response sample.

Our first reading is two entries from Wikipedia desribing different types of biases. 
* [Sampling Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias)
* [Selection Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias)

```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* What is survivorship bias?
* What is Berkson's fallacy?
```

Our second reading, from [Learning Data Science](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/intro.html) {cite}`DATA100text`, describes four of the most common types of biases.

%  	* [2.5. Accuracy](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/02/data_scope_accuracy.html)
* [2.5.1. Types of Bias](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/02/data_scope_accuracy.html#types-of-bias)

```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* Do you fill out surveys? 
  * Which type of sampling bias does that affect?
```

Our third readings, from Wikipedia, describe a type of bias that occurs for sensitive questions, and a technique to alleviate it:
* [Participation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_bias)
* [Randomized Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response)

```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* Applying the method of randomized response: 
  * Did you have sex with a prostitute in the last month?
```
