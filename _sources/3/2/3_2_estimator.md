# Estimator and Sampling Distribution

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to estimate the parameters of a model, use simulation methods to evaluate different estimators, and describe their bias and variance.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Identify the parameters of a statistical model to be estimated.
* Compute one-sample summaries (estimates) of the center of a distribution – mean, median, and trimmed mean.
* Simulate samples of data from a generative model, summarize the sample with an estimator, and examine the estimator’s sampling distribution (histogram / density estimate), its center and its spread.
* Use the center and spread of the sampling distribution to describe the accuracy of an estimator in terms of bias and variance.
* Simulate data to explore and evaluate sampling distributions of estimators in complex statistical models.
