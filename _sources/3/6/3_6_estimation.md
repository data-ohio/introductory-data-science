# * Estimation (mathematical approaches)

```{warning}
This learning outcome is considered optional in {cite}`TMM026`.
We include it here but do not develop it.

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Become aware that analytic calculation can often replace simulation to provide a formal solution to the problems above
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Describe a simple model for a game of chance such as the roll of a fair die.
* Describe probability as “area under the density curve” for continuous random variables.
* Compare the mathematical (analytical) approach and simulation-based approaches to estimation.
