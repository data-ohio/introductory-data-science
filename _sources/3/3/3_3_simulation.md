# Simulation-Based Estimation and Prediction

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to use simulation methods to understand the implications of statistical models. 
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Estimate the probability of an event for a simple probability model from a simulation.
* Assess the accuracy of an estimated probability.
* Estimate the probability of an event in a complex statistical model from a simulation.
* Estimate the conditional probability of one event given another event for models with a single component of variation and for models with more than one component of variation.
* Estimate implications (features) of a statistical model. These features might be a percentile of a distribution for a specified value of the predictor, the regression coefficient itself, or the odds for logistic regression.
* Make a prediction for new data from the model.

Our first readings, from [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) {cite}`DATA8text`, continue from the readings in {numref}`sec:statistical_model`. 
They discuss the simulation of probabilities and conditional probabilities in a fun, real-world problem and then discuss computing and simulating probabilities more generally.

Our second reading, also from [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) {cite}`DATA8text`, discusses how to use simulations to estimate percentiles.

```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* If 37 people take a test:
  * How many will score less than the median?
  * How many will score less than of equal to the median?

Our third reading, from [Learning Data Science](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/intro.html) {cite}`DATA100text`, discusses simulating the probabilities in a classic model of drawing balls from an urn.

```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* What is an urn?
