# Transparency of Methods and Analysis

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to identify clarity in methods of analysis of data and demonstrate how conclusions can be misleading.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Differentiate between settings where an algorithm will lead to biased results and to unbiased results.
* Identify the traits that demonstrate that the analysis, findings, and conclusions made from data are reliable and reproducible.
* Explain the conclusions of the analysis of data in terms that are understandable to an appropriate audience.
* Identify misinterpretations in conclusions of data analysis.

Our first reading, from [Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/) {cite}`BA-KA-HO:2021`, gives some examples where "true" data is presented in such a way as to convey false meaning. 
Similar issues were discussed in {numref}`sec:misleading_graphs`.

```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* Is global temperature increasing?
```

Our second reading, also from [Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/) {cite}`BA-KA-HO:2021`, discusses the importance of making your analysis reproducible, so others could check it.
* [8.8 Reproducibility](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-ethics.html#sec:reproducibility)
	
```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* If your analysis is correct, why do others need to be able to reproduce it?
```

Our third reading, a 2021 blog post, discusses the dangers poor data ethics pose to research.

```{admonition} Reading Question
:class: important
* If your data contradicts your hypothesis, should you still (try to) publlish it?
```

Our fourth set of readings are Wikipedia's entries on 
* [Data dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) (also known as *data snooping* or *p-hacking*)
* [HARKing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARKing)

```{admonition} Reading Questions
:class: important
* Your friend finds a hedge fund that has outperformed the market for 10 years in a row and suggests that you invest in it. Did your friend engage in data dredging? 
* You notice that when you drop heavy things on your foot, your foot hurts. Did you just engage in HARKing?
```
