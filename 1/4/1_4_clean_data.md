# Cleaning data

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to identify incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, irrelevant, or missing data and then modify, replace, or delete that information as needed.
````

```{admonition} Sample Tasks:
* Explain why some set of data has missing values and how to account for the missing
data.
* Detect outliers using graphical methods such as boxplots
* Classify outliers as errors, missing values, or unusual values.
* Clean data as necessary and eliminate variables deemed as irrelevant.
* Use a package such as tidyr in R to clean raw data sets.
* Enhance raw data as necessary by converting time zones, making currency conversions,
calculating values or time units.
* Address outliers in a set of data using mathematical techniques such as log
transformations or interpolation, or by deductive correction or deterministic imputation
for missing values.
