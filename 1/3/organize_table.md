# Organizing in Tables

Our readings, from [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) {cite}`DATA8text`, show how to create tables and manipulate them to organize the data in them.
These again use the `datascience` library, especially its `Table` object. 
In {numref}`sec:intro_pandas` we will learn about the more complex and more powerful `dataframe` object in the `pandas` library.
