# Distribution Maps

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to identify common distribution models and discern what types of data fit certain models.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Student will be able to create distribution maps of quantitative variables
  - Biological data that fit the normal distribution such as blood pressure, height, and weight
  - Data that does not fit the normal distribution such binomial or Bernoulli distributions
  - Students analyze wait times and build an appropriate distribution map based on their observations.
  - Student will investigate heat maps and choose to highlight different variables.
* Voting patterns:
  - Student will find a large data set of voting information for a certain state or county.
  - Students create maps to display the voting information.
  - Students make a hypothesis about voting patterns in a certain geographic area.
  - Student will analyze the different areas and a manipulate the fineness of measurement to highlight various areas.
  - Based on the observations, the students will verify the hypothesis.
  - Students will describe a future data set that would allow them to confirm their hypothesis.
* Plotting a data set with large variation for a market study
  - Find a data set of ages for customers that visit McDonalds for breakfast
  - Plot the entire data set using an appropriate chart
  - Look for a pattern (we hope that it does not exist)
  - Generate a hypothesis that could pertain to breakfast promotion
  - Break the data into subsets
	* Age range
	* Time of morning
	* Day of the week
   - Replot using the subsets
   - Look for a pattern to verify your hypothesis
   - Summarize the process
   - Present as a marketing pitch
