# Misleading Graphs

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to locate data visualizations and deconstruct the graph in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Find graphics in the “wild” and bring them into class to critique.
  - Example of bad graphs could be the following:
	* Non-zero axis
	* Zero axis
	* Pie charts versus bar charts versus histograms
	* Inappropriate pictograms
  - The goal of the project is for students to find intentionally misleading graphs.
  - Students will critique each example of a bad graph and explain why it is inappropriate in the given situation.
  - Students will propose a more appropriate presentation for the same data and explain why that presentation is the better choice.
  - Students will proceed to create an example using the appropriate presentation.
  - In the end the students present the inappropriate and appropriate graphs to the class for side-by-side comparison.
* Choosing to highlight proper information.
  - Student will choose variables they want to highlight from a larger set of variables.
  - Student will need to decide what they want to show.
	* Cases
	* Hospitalizations
	* Deaths
  - Student will explain the importance of one set of variables versus another.
	* Student will experiment with different color-coding schemes to highlight important variables, and decide between the following:
	  - Standard pallet
	  - Custom pallet
	* Students will justify their choice.
	* Student will discuss disability issues such as color blindness.
