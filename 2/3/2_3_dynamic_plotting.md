# Dynamic Visualization

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to compare traditional and dynamic graphing techniques and give reasons for and justify why a dynamic plot may be the appropriate choice (or is the appropriate choice for a specific data set).
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Decide the appropriate type of graph or illustrations based on the data set
  - Discuss the similarities and difference between a traditional boxplot and violin plot.
  - Consider advantages and disadvantages of using a map plot versus a heat map
* Tell the story using graphs
  - The goal of the activity is for the student to be able to create a presentation and produce a series of graphs using a large data set.
  - Students brainstorm ideas about what they would like to study.
  - Perform preliminary research and search for available data sets.
  - Generate an informal hypothesis based on their preliminary findings.
  - Gather and clean data.
  - Do trial charting and choose appropriate graphs.
  - Examine outliers and reclean the data if necessary and appropriate.
  - Generate a formal hypothesis based upon what they've been seeing in the data set.
  - Explain why the hypothesis fits their “story.”
  - Create a series of charts that verifies your hypothesis
  - Present your findings to tell the story.
  - Include the caveat that generation of a formal hypothesis and confirmation of the hypothesis on the same set of data does not settle the question.
