# Time Series Plots

```{admonition} Learning Outcome
:class: tip
Students will be able to develop an analytic model and trendline for a time series, and then predict the last n-tile of data in order to evaluate the effectiveness of their model.
```

```{admonition} Sample Tasks
* Avoid extrapolation
  - Build a model using a weather data set from 1900 to present.
  - Create a scatter plot using rain data and add a trendline.
  - Predict rainfall 1 week and 1 month into future.
  - Verify the accuracy of your model using the actual rainfall.
  - Add the updated data to your chart, and check to see if it falls within a standard deviation of the prediction.
  - Discuss why the prediction for 1 week was more accurate than for 1 month.
